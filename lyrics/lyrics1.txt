I pushed the door, the neon burned bright,
The bar was alive in the dead of the night.
Smoke curled up, wrapped around the air,
Whiskey and memories lingered everywhere.

Then it hit me, like a freight train roar,
A song I’d buried, but I’d heard before.
The chords cut deep, like a razor blade,
Took me back to the fire I thought had decayed.

It was an echo in the smoke, a spark in the dark,
Lit a flame in my soul, like a shot to the heart.
Every word, every note, it called out my name,
In this rundown bar, I’ll never be the same.
It’s the music that saves, it’s the rhythm that heals,
An anthem of truth in a world of steel.

The jukebox hummed, the crowd didn’t care,
But I stood frozen, like I wasn’t there.
The voice of the singer was raw and real,
Singing scars I’d tried to conceal.

The years fell away, like a worn-out lie,
I was a kid with a dream and a fire in my eye.
That melody lit up the pieces I’d lost,
Reminded me of who I was, no matter the cost.

It was an echo in the smoke, a spark in the dark,
Lit a flame in my soul, like a shot to the heart.
Every word, every note, it called out my name,
In this rundown bar, I’ll never be the same.
It’s the music that saves, it’s the rhythm that heals,
An anthem of truth in a world of steel.

We all need a song when the night gets cold,
A lifeline to grab, a story retold.
In the beat and the strum, we find our way,
Through the chaos and pain, it gives us a say.

It was an echo in the smoke, a spark in the dark,
Lit a flame in my soul, like a shot to the heart.
Every word, every note, it called out my name,
In this rundown bar, I’ll never be the same.
It’s the music that saves, it’s the rhythm that heals,
An anthem of truth in a world of steel.

As the song faded out, the bar came alive,
But I carried that moment, it kept me revived.
Echoes in the smoke, forever they’ll stay,
A song in my heart that won’t fade away.
